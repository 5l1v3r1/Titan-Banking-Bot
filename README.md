Everything mentioned here is for eductional purposes and everything is purely fictional. I purposely redacted a lot of code and messed stuffs up since im a pussy.


What is in here:

Kernel mode rootkit, does not trigger KPP, uses callbacks. redacted hidden VFS code. But there is a filter code to prevent access. 

UEFI based rootkit - from scratch does not use any public lib (i am not going to release this for personal purposes and also does not bypass secure boot)

Kernel mode keylogger


Usermode Bot Features:

Send files to block access to driver.

Send registry keys to block access to driver.

Track Grabber 1/2

Back Connect that can start: hidden desktop or reverse socks5 (UI made in QT)

Hidden Desktop - the actual code uses win32u undocumented functions

Reverse Socks5

Formgrabber + webinjects for IE, FF, Chrome, Edge ( edge i  hijack and handle and inject)

DH key exchange for AES.

Communicates with AFD.sys for networking. Has chunked reply praser.


PHP Code:

No framework needed.

Has server sided based polymorphism for driver. 


Register as service



A purely fictional story:

Why I am releasing the code? 

I fell in love with someone and apparently they didnt feel the same way about me. So that being said i guess you can figure out what this is.



In Conclusion:

I am not reponsible for any financial losses or damages of any sort. This is all purely educational and I made this a long time ago.
